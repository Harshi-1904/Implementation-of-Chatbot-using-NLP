# Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP ( WEEK-1 ASSIGNMENT)
In Week-1 assignment we have  designed  various user inputs as intents. Each intent corresponds to a specific purpose or task, such as greetings, asking about the weather, or making a complaint. This intents helps for the chatbot to  process the user input, classifies it into one of the predefined intents, and then provides an appropriate response.
These intents  will help   the chatbot  to perform in more interactive way .This intents uses  Natural Language Processing (NLP), which help to understand and process human language.

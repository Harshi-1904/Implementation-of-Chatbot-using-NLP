# Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP ( WEEK-1 ASSIGNMENT)
In Week-1 assignment we have  designed  various user inputs as intents. Each intent corresponds to a specific purpose or task, such as greetings, asking about the weather, or making a complaint. This intents helps for the chatbot to  process the user input, classifies it into one of the predefined intents, and then provides an appropriate response.
These intents  will help   the chatbot  to perform in more interactive way .This intents uses  Natural Language Processing (NLP), which help to understand and process human language.


# Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP ( WEEK-2 ASSIGNMENT)
In Week-2 assignment we have used TfidfVectorizer and LogisticRegression.By TfidfVectorizer we are able  to convert text data into numerical representations, which is  especially useful when dealing with text data for machine learning tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and chatbots.And Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, especially when the target variable is categorical. By using these two, we have created the chatbot responsive i.e which gives output according to the user input.This makes the chatbot more interactive with the user.


**#Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP(WEEK-3 Assignment)**
In Week-3 assignment we have created a user interface using streamlit.Creating an Intents.Json file , which helps for storing the user queries as intents.Creating a Python file  which uses as backend code for running the application.In that we have imported the necessary libraries and Intents.Json file.We have created one csv file, in that csv all the history is stored,that is also imported in the python file.In Python file  we have created main function.In that main function we have written the code that is related to three sections one is Home section .Home section is  related to text box for user input another one for replies given by chatbot.Another one is Conversation History,in that we are able to see the history.Last one is the About,which contains the breif description of Project,dataset,technologies used and so on..Finally we have deployed this Chatbot in Localhost by running the command streamlit run chatbot.py in Terminal.



This is all about the project Implementation of Chatbot using NLP

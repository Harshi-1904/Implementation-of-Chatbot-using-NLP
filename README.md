# Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP ( WEEK-1 ASSIGNMENT)
In Week-1 assignment we have  designed  various user inputs as intents. Each intent corresponds to a specific purpose or task, such as greetings, asking about the weather, or making a complaint. This intents helps for the chatbot to  process the user input, classifies it into one of the predefined intents, and then provides an appropriate response.
These intents  will help   the chatbot  to perform in more interactive way .This intents uses  Natural Language Processing (NLP), which help to understand and process human language.


# Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP ( WEEK-2 ASSIGNMENT)
In Week-2 assignment we have used TfidfVectorizer and LogisticRegression.By TfidfVectorizer we are able  to convert text data into numerical representations, which is  especially useful when dealing with text data for machine learning tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and chatbots.And Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, especially when the target variable is categorical. By using these two, we have created the chatbot responsive i.e which gives output according to the user input.This makes the chatbot more interactive with the user.

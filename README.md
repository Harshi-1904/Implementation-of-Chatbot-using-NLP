# Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP ( WEEK-1 ASSIGNMENT)
In Week-1 assignment we have  designed  various user inputs as intents. Each intent corresponds to a specific purpose or task, such as greetings, asking about the weather, or making a complaint. This intents helps for the chatbot to  process the user input, classifies it into one of the predefined intents, and then provides an appropriate response.
This intents  helps to create a user interactive chatbot by using  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which help to understand and process human language.
